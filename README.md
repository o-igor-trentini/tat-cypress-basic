Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Testing online school.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v16.13.1` and `8.3.0` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

You can run the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.

## Desktop

Run `npm test` to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

## Mobile

Run `npm test-mobile` to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run `npm run open-mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport.
